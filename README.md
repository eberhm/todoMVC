todoMVC
=======

Basic TODO list implementation for JS Training Sessions @Trovit


Day 1:
=====

Just a first approach on MVC. Basic components and interactions defined and list view implementation.

Day 2:
=====

Full MVC implementation of a simple todo list. As homework we left TodoController to become a Collection and to add an extra view with a summary of authors with count of todos.


Day 3:
=====

Initial migration of the current application to a Backbone application. A lot of things left to do:

-Routing

-Controllers

-Repositories


Parts of the API we did not cover (and would be good to read)

View

  events
  
  view.$el
  
  template
  
  
And much more...
