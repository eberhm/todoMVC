todoMVC
=======

Basic TODO list implementation for JS Training Sessions @Trovit


Day 1:
=====

Just a first approach on MVC. Basic components and interactions defined and list view implementation.

Day 2:
=====

Full MVC implementation of a simple todo list. As homework we left TodoController to become a Collection and to add an extra view with a summary of authors with count of todos.
